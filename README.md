This is a colour picker made in the wonderful Visual Basic.

Has all the basic feautres such as RGB, HEX, magnifier (including zoom), colour saving, mouse position etc.

More feautres are being added throughout time. 

Feel free to test out the latest beta or use the latest stable version.

https://github.com/theo3334/vbColourPicker/releases/ has the releases, including stable and the latest beta.

The files currently here are in BETA. Use at your own risk! (Although suprisingly, it's relatively unbuggy (as for now), probably because I fix each feautre before adding new ones haha).
