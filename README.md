This is a simple colour picker made in the wonderful Visual Basic

Has all the basic feautres plus a few more

More feautres are being added throughout time

Feel free to test it out the latest beta or use the latest stable version

https://github.com/theo3334/vbColourPicker/releases/ has the releases

The files currently here are in BETA. Use at your own risk! (Although suprisingly, it's relatively unbuggy (as for now))
